    <h1><span style="background-color: lightyellow;">Hello World!</span></h1>
    <p class="about_opening">Glad to meet you here,I am <span class="bg-highlight">YeEum Lee</span> <br /> and I have been working as a freelance front-end developer for a year and currently studying Software Development.
    </p>
    <p class="about_main">
        During my freelance work period, I have been developing high quality of pages using <span class="bg-highlight">HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap3.</span>
        Prior to this job, I was in a 6-month intensive web design program, Technical Web Designer , at BCIT which was my first step into the computing world.
        In addition to this, I am studying Computer Systems at BCIT continuously learning <span class="bg-highlight">Java, C++</span>, and computer science knowledge and <span class="bg-highlight">developing the android app</span> using Java to practice my skills.
        I would like to keep strengthening my front-end skills while studying back-end area. It helps me to think of user-experience and code design while
        swimming in a coding pool.
    </p>
    <p class="about_opening">
        Iâ€™m looking forward to taking my career with you <br /> if you are looking for a passionate and skillful <span class="bg-highlight">front-end developer </span>and want to work with me!
